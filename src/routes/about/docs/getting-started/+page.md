# Getting started

We work together on GitHub. The
[felix-schindler/com](https://github.com/felix-schindler/com) repository is the
central starting point for developing. In there is a single SvelteKit app, where
everything is happening.

## Frontend

```text
ðŸ“‚ src
â”— ðŸ“‚ routes
  â”£ ðŸ“‚ about - Pages with access for everyone
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ auth - Login form
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ forget - Forgot password form
  â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ register - Quiz for new customers
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ contact - Contact form
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ ctf - Current CTF page
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ imprint - Impressum nach `Â§5 TMG`
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ privacy - Privacy policy (always has to be up-to-date!)
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ team - Team showcase
  â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ docs - Access for Admins only; All pages are written in Markdown
  â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ +page - General home page
  â”— ðŸ“‚ app - Access for authenticated users only
    â”£ ðŸ“‚ status - Status page for the products of the customer
    â”— ðŸ“œ +page - Customer Dashboard
```

## Backend

Unattached from that repo, there is our
[PocketBase Backend](https://pb.schindlerfelix.de/_/). Since you seem to be
working for us, you can go over there and log in with your admin account, with
which you already logged in to on this website.

If there's anything that can't be done in the PocketBase Backend, it's done
within the SvelteKit app.

## Deployment

The website is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
